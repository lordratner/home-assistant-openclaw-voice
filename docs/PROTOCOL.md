# Paired voice protocol v1

Implemented contract: protocol major 1, minor 0. Both products ship together as
0.0.1-dev.0. This is a development candidate, not a claim of live acceptance.

## Ownership and transport

OpenClaw selects one existing agent, inference controls, speech policy and the
persistent target. HA selects connection, conversation mode and playback target.
No client field can choose an arbitrary OC agent, session key, provider or model.
The plugin registers `/plugins/openclaw-home-assistant/v1` on the existing
Gateway listener; it does not open another port. Use HTTPS across untrusted
networks. HTTP is supported for controlled loopback/trusted-network development.
Redirects are never followed by the HA client.

Responses and error bodies use `Cache-Control: no-store`. Control endpoints use
JSON. Job responses and microphone/text uploads use UTF-8 newline-delimited
JSON, one object per line, maximum 65,536 bytes per line. Audio chunks use base64.
A response is not successful merely because its HTTP status is 200: it must end
with a valid terminal event. No data may follow the terminal frame.

## Pairing and administration

Owner Gateway RPC methods require `operator.admin`:

| Method | Parameters |
| --- | --- |
| `openclaw_home_assistant.status` | `{}` |
| `openclaw_home_assistant.pairing.issue` | optional `label` |
| `openclaw_home_assistant.clients.list` | `{}` |
| `openclaw_home_assistant.clients.revoke` | `client_id` |
| `openclaw_home_assistant.persistent.rebind` | `expected_revision`, `session_key` |

Pairing codes are one-use, expire after five minutes, and are stored as hashes.
`POST /pair` accepts only `pairing_code`; it returns `client_id`, `client_token`,
`agent_id`, and `capabilities`. HA stores the scoped token in its normal config
entry storage. This is a credential: HA backups must remain protected. OC keeps
only its hash. Neither a Gateway owner token nor provider key is copied to HA.
There are at most eight outstanding pairing codes and sixteen clients per
agent/profile namespace. Pairing has a ten-attempt/IP/minute limit. Authenticated
requests have a 120-request/client/minute limit.

Subsequent HTTP requests use `Authorization: Bearer <client_token>`.
`DELETE /pair` revokes that client. Owner revocation also fences active output
and requests cancellation of jobs owned by that client. Changing the selected
agent invalidates old-client access; it never migrates their histories.

## Control endpoints

| Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /capabilities` | Protocol/revision, selected-agent ID, languages, execution modes and limits |
| `POST /conversations` | Open/reuse caller-bound conversation with `protocol_major`, `profile_revision`, `ha_conversation_id`, `mode` |
| `DELETE /conversations/{handle}` | Close caller's mapping, never delete native history |
| `POST /turns` | `protocol_major`, `profile_revision`, UUIDv7 `request_id`, `conversation_handle`, `text`, optional reference `context` |
| `POST /tts` | Incremental text upload and canonical audio response |
| `POST /stt` | Incremental canonical PCM upload and one finalized transcript |
| `GET /jobs/{id}` | Caller-owned execution/result status |
| `GET /jobs/{id}/events?after=N` | Replay/resume the same job, never execute it again |
| `POST /jobs/{id}/cancel` | Request output fencing/cancellation |

Modes are `persistent` and `per_conversation`. A fresh HA conversation in the
latter mode gets one fresh OC session; follow-ups reuse it. Persistent target
selection stays in OC. An unset initial target is created and durably bound on
first use. Missing/replaced targets fail closed. Proven native rollover lineage
may be adopted by a *new* conversation; an old physical-session handle ends.
HA mode overrides survive integration reload, but not arbitrary HA process
restarts; expired/changed handles require a new conversation. Idle bindings are
bounded to 1,024 entries and expire after fifteen minutes. Fresh history is not
incognito and does not disable normal agent memory, tools or permissions.

Profile revisions bind configuration snapshots. New work rejects a stale
revision; an already accepted exact request can still be recovered. Integration
capabilities refresh every thirty seconds. Profile/agent changes cannot silently
retarget an old conversation. Reload stops/fences old owned work; it does not
promise uninterrupted completion across configuration changes.

## Job events and recovery

Every event contains `protocol_major`, `profile_revision`, `request_id`, `job_id`,
monotonically contiguous `sequence`, and `type`. Optional response headers
`X-OpenClaw-Job-ID` and `X-OpenClaw-Request-ID` identify accepted work early.

- `phase`: running.
- `model`: observed actual provider/model, not a guessed pre-hook selection.
- `text_delta`: `message_id`, speakable assistant `text`; multiple assistant
  messages are separated by HA without repeating earlier text.
- `transcript`: final text, `final: true`, actual STT mode.
- `audio_start`: canonical segment metadata, actual sentence synthesis mode.
- `audio_chunk`: `segment`, base64 `audio`.
- `audio_end`: segment complete.
- `done`: stage-specific completion metadata; not proof of audible playback.
- `error` / `cancelled`: terminal failure/cancellation; never read raw exceptions aloud.

Durable UUIDv7 receipts bind caller, request ID, kind, profile and canonical
payload fingerprint. Conflicting payload reuse fails. A duplicate turn never
executes again. If execution ownership was lost on process death, report
`interrupted` / `execution_outcome_unknown`; do not infer that tools did nothing.
HA reconnects only to the same job's events/status; it never POSTs the prompt
again to recover a lost reply. Recoverable completed text must match the prefix
already delivered, or recovery fails rather than repeat/change spoken content.
STT/TTS upload duplicates are rejected as already admitted; input is not replayed.

Defaults: 16 active jobs/profile, 4/client, 64 retained in-memory jobs, 2,048
receipts, five-minute job deadline, 1 MiB event window/job, 1 MiB combined retained
result budget, 24-hour request-age window (+ clock-skew allowance), one-hour
completed-result availability. Results/receipts are reclaimed on subsequent
state operations; these are availability bounds, not guaranteed disk-erasure
alarms. Native OC history and HA's own caches have separate retention policies.
The plugin metadata file is capped at 8 MiB and requires a single Gateway owner
process. Same-process reload generations share serialization; cross-process
shared-state writers are unsupported. Unknown state versions fail closed.

Cancellation immediately fences output. Some native buffered provider calls
cannot be aborted; `cancellation_confirmed: false` is intentional and must not be
presented as confirmation that provider computation or tool side effects stopped.

## STT and TTS uploads

Both start with `type: start`, protocol major, profile revision, UUIDv7 request
ID and language. Upload frames thereafter have contiguous sequences beginning
at one; the final frame is `type: end` with the next sequence.

STT additionally declares `encoding: pcm_s16le`, `sample_rate: 16000`, `channels: 1`.
Audio frames contain `type: audio` and base64 `audio`, at most 32,768 decoded bytes
and complete 16-bit samples. Total microphone input is at most 2 MiB (~65.5 s).
OC wraps the finalized input in a private WAV for its native transcription API;
spool files are removed on normal completion/error/cancellation. Crash cleanup
is not yet a verified retention guarantee. Empty input performs no inference.

TTS frames contain `type: text` and `text`, at most 65,536 UTF-8 bytes in total.
Sentence segmentation is bounded (600 UTF-16 units), Unicode-safe and avoids
common title/decimal chunk-boundary errors; it is not a universal linguistic
parser. Native progressive audio is preferred. An explicit unsupported-streaming
capability falls back to buffered sentence synthesis; provider failures do not
trigger replay after partial output. Fully buffered text also works.

Provider containers are decoded to one continuous mono PCM16/24 kHz WAV with a
single header. FFmpeg must be on PATH. Accepted self-describing inputs include
MP3, WAV, FLAC, Ogg/Opus, AAC, M4A, WebM and AIFF; not every codec/device combination
has native acceptance evidence. Raw PCM without declared metadata is rejected.
WAV PCM/float metadata is parsed within a bounded header to avoid FFmpeg's 64 KiB
SPDIF probe; raw decode settings come from that header, never a provider name.
Canonical output is limited to 32 MiB. HA prefers WAV but native device format
requests take precedence. Device-side conversion can add buffering.

## Data and failure boundaries

Plugin state stores client hashes, bindings, receipts and bounded recoverable
completed text/transcripts, not provider credentials or full input prompts.
Streaming audio replay exists only in bounded process memory; STT has temporary
private files. OC/HA/provider logs and caches remain independently governed.
HA diagnostics allowlist operational facts and exclude URLs, identities, tokens,
prompts, replies, audio and arbitrary backend extensions.

Profile change, expired mapping, missing persistent target, revoked credential,
request conflict, replay gap, capacity and provider failure are real errors,
not excuses to silently start another agent turn or change provider policy.
