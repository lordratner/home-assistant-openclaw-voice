# Current product candidate evidence — 2026-10-29

Bridge dev10 / HAdev6, protocol1.2. Full module suites138OC+90HA passed. Added
regressions cover missing optional dependencies, native-policy batch alternatives
and legacy explicit selection, independent stage languages/readiness, duplicate
and concurrent pairing, v1 migration, same-backend URL moves, wrong-backend/agent
reauth guards and native buffered HA TTS with unavailable OC TTS. Offline metadata/
translation/package validators passed. Disposable native source pair passed;
archive-loaded proof and hashes are recorded separately with packaged artifacts.

No new real-provider/device acceptance, installed activation, public CI success or
formal quality tier is claimed. See PRODUCT.md, COMPATIBILITY.md and QUALITY.md.
The dated sections below are historical evidence, not current deployment status.

# Acceptance evidence — 2026-10-28 development candidate

Evidence levels are distinct. Automated checks are not the 42 planned acceptance
cases, and a native synthetic fixture is not a real-provider or physical-speaker
test. No release gate is waived by this document.

## Historical executed development checks

- Node suite: 74 tests passed, zero failed/cancelled/skipped.
- HA suite: 40 tests passed; dependency/HA deprecation and AppKey warnings remain.
- Production plugin + native HA paired proof: passed on OC 2026.10.3 / Node
  24.18.1 and HA 2026.10.4 / Python 3.14.10, FFmpeg 7.1.5.
- Full native config flow, three registered entities, native batch STT, spoken
  query, interactive start, follow-up mode retention and unload passed.
- Native playback bytes arrived before the model's final text. A separate gated
  normalizer test withheld provider EOF until audio was observed, then checked
  owned transport cancellation/release. Neither proves physical sound.
- PCM/float WAV headers split across provider chunks, 8/16/24/32-bit integer,
  32/64-bit float, stereo-to-mono, resampling, finite-data trailers, malformed
  metadata, truncation and mixed WAV/FLAC sentences have decoder checks.
- Native bundled OpenAI buffered TTS and ElevenLabs progressive audio paths used
  synthetic local HTTP providers. Explicit profile STT/TTS model/voice differed
  from native defaults and the expected overrides reached those providers.
- Normal selected-agent tools/workspace and incremental text passed; saved
  shared-session model/thinking/fast preferences stayed unchanged.
- An explicitly denied, registered fixture tool was attempted through native
  dispatch and did not execute. A registered test-harness-owned locked session
  rejected conflicting model selection before any inference, preserving its lock.
- Five admin RPC methods denied a read-scope client with no cached owner device
  credentials. Production scoped pairing, exact request replay without another
  turn, caller ownership and revocation also have executed evidence.
- HA overlap rejection, task-local speech-feed association, 60-second pending
  playback expiry and diagnostics allowlist/redaction have targeted checks.

## Mapping to planned cases

“Partial” means useful executed evidence exists but the entire acceptance setup
or its real-world variants have not been claimed. Detailed original pass criteria
remain in `planning/05-ACCEPTANCE-AND-TEST-MATRIX.md`.

| T05 | Not run: requires approved real-provider calls |
| T07, T12 | Run-scoped model/thinking and unchanged preferences, native lock rejection; actual fast-tier/account/runtime support matrix still partial |

| T19 | Job admission/backpressure/owner generations and HA overlap isolation checked; real shared-session multi-room load pending |
| T20, T21, T25, T26 | Closed control inputs, fresh-history mappings, atomic initial binding, rebind/reset/rollover contract checks |
| T27 | Native setup/options/reauth source, stable entity IDs and profile-revision cache key; real cache/device behavior partial |
| T28 | Not run on physical clients/local-intent deployment |
| T29, T30 | Scoped credentials, five native admin denials, revocation and allowlisted diagnostics checks; installation logs/backups still operator-owned |
| T31 | Stage-specific status and first-byte timestamps; no audible-completion claim |
| T32, T33 | Public SDK/source and exact tested pair; broader versions are not certified |
| T34 | Original MIT code and provenance documented; no application-source copying |
| T35 | Native tool denial and locked session fail closed; native approval UI/account-specific policies pending canary |
| T36 | Bounded stores/queues/jobs, owner-loss, TTL and schema rejection checks; no cross-version migration or crash-spool cleanup certification |
| T37 | Durable idempotency, request conflict, replay gap and ambiguous work checks; no automatic prompt replay |
| T38, T39 | Review artifacts and installation/rollback procedure prepared; unfamiliar-operator/live upgrade/rollback not run |
| T40 | Planning, source checkpoints, failure notes and continuation ledger maintained |

## What is not claimed

The original development checks above did not change production services/config,
installed bundles, provider accounts, real user audio, HA default pipelines or
household devices. No public release or HACS publication occurred in that work.
This candidate is **not release-certified**: the remaining
real-provider/runtime/approval/client/hardware and installation/rollback gates
must be run in an explicitly approved controlled canary.

## Failed attempts retained

The provider-EOF test initially timed out: FFmpeg's WAV demuxer still probes
64 KiB after an extensible-header rewrite. That rewrite did not solve latency.
The final parser derives raw decode settings from bounded WAV metadata and strips
only that wrapper; gated early-output and cancellation now pass. Bare raw PCM is
still rejected. A first edit attempt used a wrong relative working directory;
it made no source changes before being corrected.

The first native lock fixture tried to patch an ordinary session. OC correctly
rejected that because only a registered harness owner may create/patch locked
sessions. The proof now registers its own explicit-only synthetic harness and
creates only its own locked session through the public API. It does not loosen
ownership, patch core, or alter the production plugin's authority.

## 2026-10-28 next-turn settings/timing checkpoint

Candidate 0.0.1-dev.1: 81 OC + 41 HA tests pass; extended native proof verifies
in-flight settings isolation, next-turn model/thinking switch on the same handle,
retry recovery without redispatch, eight owner-RPC denials, content-free timing,
and continued early decoded audio. This is disposable-runtime proof only. Live
installation, realistic latency benchmarking and acoustic start timing remain
separate acceptance gates. See docs/TIMING.md for measurement boundaries.

## 2026-10-29 optional realtime/clarification qualification

HA integration dev.3 already forwards bounded PCM uploads and the terminal
`continue_conversation` boolean to native HA APIs. Companion bridge dev.6 uses
the optional public finite-transcription runtime from the reviewed core change;
capability depends on the configured provider/model. Stock hosts and unsupported
selections retain batch STT, with no automatic replay after streaming admission.
The existing v1 wire contract and HA code need no change for these features.
Backend capabilities/profile refresh every 30 seconds.

This section records source/contract review, not additional paired-runtime or
inference execution. Candidate-core paired proof, live provider finalization and
real cold/warm latency remain separate gates. Physical clarification playback
must be followed by listening without another wake word; its answer must retain
conversation context, and completion/stop must end listening. A terminal flag,
device feature bit or synthetic satellite is not proof of that hardware behavior.

## Stale binding recovery candidate — 2026-10-29

Bridge dev.7 + HA dev.4: scoped regression coverage includes retained-ID profile
change/expiry, same native history/mode, caller/target fences, overlap/cancellation
and known-job no-redispatch even when replay/status fails before text. Native
HA2026.10.4 retains the satellite ID through the legacy null-ID error and then
processes clarification/follow-up with the replacement transport. The isolated
production-plugin/HA paired proof also passes with synthetic model/speech
providers. These are local/disposable proofs, not installation or physical
acceptance of these versions. Live activation and bathroom retesting remain
separate gates.

## Comprehensive logging candidate — 2026-10-29

OCdev.9 + HAdev.5: all36source modules reviewed, shared diagnostic contract and
per-module audit recorded. OC125tests and HA73tests pass. Native paired proof
checks bounded rings, common request/job/span correlation, no private canaries,
normal/hidden-target native controls, continuation/stop/recovery and early audio.
Fault injection covers auth/status, metadata/receipt/storage, timeout, decoder
races, primary-vs-cleanup errors, startup diagnostics and actual action receipt
correlation. This is source/fixture proof, not deployed logging or physical
acceptance. See [logging guide](LOGGING.md).
